# Fireventuino

## A project that aims to utilize Arduino to create a smoke detector that is accurate and capable of givng caution and pre-caution

This repository contains the code I created in colaboration with my friends for their Research Project, Fireventuino.
It is a smoke detector that notifies the client when a smoke is detected, and sounds an alarm when a fire is detected.
The files in this repository do the following:

* Detect smoke and read temperature via arduino
* Send sensor readings to ThingSpeak via ESP8266 Module
* Read data from ThingSpeak via python
* Send Emails when smoke is detected using python
